## Testing Inherited Code ##

# Youâ€™ve finally arrived at the last challenge, testing inherited 
# code. This section is much like the previous ones in that it 
# recapitulates a previously seen example and then proceeds to test 
# it. The example used here is the final Bicycle hierarchy from 
# Chapter 6, Acquiring Behavior Through Inheritance. Even though that 
# hierarchy eventually proved unsuitable for inheritance, the 
# underlying code is fine and serves admirably as a basis for these 
# tests.
