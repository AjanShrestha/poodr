# Reducing Costs with Duck Typing

# The purpose of object-oriented design is to reduce the cost of 
# change. Now that you know messages are at the design center of your 
# application, and now that you are committed to the construction of 
# rigorously defined public interfaces, you can combine these two 
# ideas into a powerful design technique that further reduces your 
# costs.
# This technique is known as duck typing. Duck types are public 
# interfaces that are not tied to any specific class. These 
# across-class interfaces add enormous flexibility to your 
# application by replacing costly dependencies on class with more 
# forgiving dependencies on messages.
# Duck typed objects are chameleons that are defined more by their 
# behavior than by their class. This is how the technique gets its 
# name; if an object quacks like a duck and walks like a duck, then 
# its class is immaterial, itâ€™s a duck.
