# Sharing Role Behavior with Modules #

# What will happen when FastFeet develops a need for recumbent mountain bikes?
# If the solution to this new design problem feels elusive, thatâ€™s 
# perfectly under- standable. Creation of a recumbent mountain bike 
# subclass requires combining the qualities of two existing 
# subclasses, something that inheritance cannot readily accommodate. 
# Even more distressing is the fact that this failure illustrates 
# just one of several ways in which inheritance can go wrong.

# To reap benefits from using inheritance you must understand not 
# only how to write inheritable code but also when it makes sense to 
# do so. Use of classical inheritance is always optional; every 
# problem that it solves can be solved another way. Because no design 
# technique is free, creating the most cost-effective application 
# requires making informed tradeoffs between the relative costs and 
# likely benefits of alternatives.
