# Acquiring Behavior Through Inheritance

## Understanding Classical Inheritance ##

# The idea of inheritance may seem complicated but as with all 
# complexity, there’s a simplifying abstraction. Inheritance is, at 
# its core, a mechanism for automatic message delegation. It defines 
# a forwarding path for not-understood messages. It creates 
# relationships such that, if one object cannot respond to a received 
# message, it delegates that message to another. You don’t have to 
# write code to explicitly delegate the message, instead you define 
# an inheritance relationship between two objects and the forwarding 
# happens automatically.

# In classical inheritance these relationships are defined by 
# creating subclasses. Messages are forwarded from subclass to 
# superclass; the shared code is defined in the class hierarchy.

# The term classical is a play on the word class, not a nod to an 
# archaic technique, and it serves to distinguish this superclass/
# subclass mechanism from other inheritance techniques. JavaScript, 
# for example, has prototypical inheritance and Ruby has modules 
# (more on modules in the next chapter), both of which also provide a 
# way to share code via automatic delegation of messages.
