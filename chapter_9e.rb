## Testing Duck Types ##
# The Testing Incoming Messages section in this chapter wandered into 
# the territory of testing roles, but while it introduced the issue, 
# it did not provide a satisfactory resolution. Itâ€™s time to return 
# to that topic and examine how to test duck types. This section 
# shows how to create tests that role players can share and then 
# returns to the original problem and uses shareable tests to prevent 
# test doubles from becoming obsolete.
